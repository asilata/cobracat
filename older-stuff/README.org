* Cobracat: Computation of Braid Actions on Categories 

We implement braid group actions on the homotopy category of complexes of projective modules over the zig-zag algebra as defined in the article "Notes on link homology" by Asaeda and Khovanov.

This is what the various files do.

** complexes.sage

Defines the sage class for complexes of projective modules over a possibly non-commutative but finite dimensional (finite length) algebra over a field.

** zigzagalgebra.sage

Defines the zig-zag algebra of a (doubled) quiver.

** zigzagmodules.sage

Defines projective modules over the zig-zag algebra.

** braidactions.sage

Implements spherical twists by the standard projective modules over the zig-zag algebra.
